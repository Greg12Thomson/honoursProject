This is a collaborative project with Amazon Development Centre Scotland to create a skills ontology to be used in their internal jobs sight. We are wanting to extend the job data Amazon holds by adding skills/tags to all current and future jobs. Job Tagger is a prototype system used to suggest skill for a given job description. Input a job description and Job Tagger will return ten suggested skills needed for that job.
